# My Pokedex
This is a project to set up a webpage that will show list of 150 different Pokemon.  A user will then be able to navigate to individual pokemon pages by clicking on their name and on the new page obtain further information about that pokemon.

## To get started

Run the following scripts in your terminal:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You will then be able to find ehe server running on http://localhost:3000

## User Stories
- [x] I want to be able to see a list of Pokemon.
- [x] I want to be able to click on a Pokemon and be directed to a page that shows more details about that Pokemon.
- [x] I want to be able to navigate back to the main list easily.

## Things that were considered but not implemented
These are things I would like to have been able to do with more time:
- 1. Have the landing page display a bit more information about the Pokemon, especially a picture of each one.
- 2. Tidy up how the types are displaying by removing the last comma.
- 3. General styling improvements to enhance the look of the page.
