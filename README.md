# My Pokedex
This is a project to set up a webpage that will show list of 150 different Pokemon.  A user will then be able to navigate to individual pokemon pages by clicking on their name and on the new page obtain further information about that pokemon.

## To get started

```
npm install
npm start
```

The server will be running on http://localhost:3000
